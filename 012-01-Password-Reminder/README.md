## About

 * I was instucted to write this code for a Clarusway assignment.
 * Objective: To improve your conditional algorithm and string operations skills.

## Task

Let's say; you left a message in the past that prints a password you need. To see the password you wrote, you need to enter your name and the program should recognize you.
Write a program that:
* Takes the first name from the user and compares it to yours,
* Then if the name the user entered is the same as yours, print out such as : "Hello, Joseph! The password is : W@12",
* If the name the user entered is not the same as yours, print out such as : "Hello, Amina! See you later."

## Key Features

* There are currently no features.


## How To Use

* Run the code in your preferred command line or IDE
